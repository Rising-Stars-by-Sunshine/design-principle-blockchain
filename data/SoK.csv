Conference Paper,"Almashaqbeh G,Solomon R",SoK: privacy-preserving computing in the blockchain era,"Privacy is a huge concern for cryptocurrencies and blockchains as most of these systems log everything in the clear. This has resulted in several academic and industrial initiatives to address privacy. Starting with the UTXO model of Bitcoin, initial works brought confidentiality and anonymity to payments. Recent works have expanded to support more generalized forms of private computation. Such solutions tend to be highly involved as they rely on advanced cryptographic primitives and creative techniques to handle issues related to dealing with private records (e.g. concurrency and double spending). This situation makes it hard to comprehend the current state-of-the-art, much less build on top of it. To address these challenges, we develop a systematization of knowledge for privacy-preserving solutions in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. After motivating design challenges, we devise two systematization frameworks-the first as a stepping stone to the second- and use them to study the state-of-the-art. For our first framework, we study the zero-knowledge proof systems used in surveyed solutions, based on their key features and limitations. Our second is for privacy-preserving solutions; we define several dimensions to categorize the surveyed schemes and, in doing so, identify two major paradigms employed to achieve private computation. We go on to provide insights to guide solutions' adoption and development. Finally, we touch upon challenges related to limited functionality and accommodating new developments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9797340,,2022,,,124-139,IEEE,,,2022 IEEE 7th European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P),2022
Conference Paper,"Bonneau J,Miller A,Clark J,Narayanan A,Kroll JA,Felten EW",Sok: Research perspectives and challenges for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,"Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptographic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bit coin and the many related crypto currencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bit coin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bit coin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bit coin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disinter mediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disinter mediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7163021,,2015,,,104-121,IEEE,,,2015 IEEE symposium on security and privacy,2015
Journal Article,Wang G,SoK: Understanding BFT Consensus in the Age of Blockchains,"Blockchain as an enabler to current Internet infrastructure has provided many unique features and revolutionized current distributed systems into a new era. Its decentralization, immutability, and transparency have attracted many applications to adopt the design philosophy of blockchain and customize various replicated solutions. Under the hood of blockchain, consensus protocols play the most important role to achieve distributed replication systems. The distributed system community has extensively studied the technical components of consensus to reach agreement among a group of nodes. Due to trust issues, it is hard to design a resilient system in practical situations because of the existence of various faults. Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) is regarded as an ideal candidate that can tolerate arbitrary faulty behaviors. However, the inherent complexity of BFT consensus protocols and their rapid evolution makes it hard to practically adapt themselves into application domains. There are many excellent Byzantine-based replicated solutions and ideas that have been contributed to improving performance, availability, or resource efficiency. This paper conducts a systematic and comprehensive study on BFT consensus protocols with a specific focus on the blockchain era. We explore both general principles and practical schemes to achieve consensus under Byzantine settings. We then survey, compare, and categorize the state-of-the-art solutions to understand BFT consensus in detail. For each representative protocol, we conduct an in-depth discussion of its most important architectural building blocks as well as the key techniques they used. We aim that this paper can provide system researchers and developers a concrete view of the current design landscape and help them find solutions to concrete problems.  Finally, we present several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring BFT consensus protocols in the age of blockchains.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/911,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2021,,,,,,,,2021
Conference Paper,"Chatzigiannis P,Baldimtsi F,Chalkias K",SoK: auditability and accountability in distributed payment systems,"Enforcement of policy regulations and availability of auditing mechanisms are crucial building blocks for the adoption of distributed payment systems. In this work we review a number of existing proposals for distributed payment systems that offer some form of auditability for regulators. We identify two major distinct lines of work: payment systems that are not privacy-preserving such as Bitcoin, where regulation functionalities are typically tailored for organizations controlling many accounts, and privacy-preserving payment systems where regulation functionalities are typically targeted to user level. We provide a systematization methodology over several axes of characteristics and performance, while highlighting insights and research gaps that we have identified, such as lack of dispute-resolution solutions between the regulator and the entity under audit, and the incompatibility of ledger pruning or off-chain protocols with regulatory requirements. Based on our findings, we propose a number of exciting future research directions.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-78375-4_13,,2021,,,311-337,Springer,,,International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security,2021
Conference Paper,"Eskandari S,Moosavi S,Clark J",Sok: Transparent dishonesty: front-running attacks on blockchain,"We consider front-running to be a course of action where an entity benefits from prior access to privileged market information about upcoming transactions and trades. Front-running has been an issue in financial instrument markets since the 1970s. With the advent of the blockchain technology, front-running has resurfaced in new forms we explore here, instigated by blockchain’s decentralized and transparent nature. In this paper, we draw from a scattered body of knowledge and instances of front-running across the top 25 most active decentral applications (DApps) deployed on Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, we carry out a detailed analysis of Status.im initial coin offering (ICO) and show evidence of abnormal miner’s behavior indicative of front-running token purchases. Finally, we map the proposed solutions to front-running into useful categories.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43725-1_13,,2020,,,170-189,Springer,,,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2020
Journal Article,"Baum C,Chiang JH,David B,Frederiksen TK,Gentile L",Sok: Mitigation of front-running in decentralized finance,"Front-running is the malicious, and often illegal, act of both manipulating the order of pending trades and injecting additional trades to make a profit at the cost of other users. In decentralized finance (DeFi), front-running strategies exploit both public knowledge of user trades from transactions pending on the network and the miner's ability to determine the final transaction order. Given the financial loss and increased transaction load resulting from adversarial front-running in decentralized finance, novel cryptographic protocols have been proposed to mitigate such attacks in the permission-less blockchain setting. We systematize and discuss the state-of-the-art of front-running mitigation in decentralized finance, and illustrate remaining attacks and open challenges.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1628,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2021,,,,,,,,2021
Journal Article,"Raikwar M,Gligoroski D,Kralevska K",SoK of used cryptography in blockchain,"The underlying fundaments of blockchain are cryptography and cryptographic concepts that provide reliable and secure decentralized solutions. Although many recent papers study the use-cases of blockchain in different industrial areas, such as finance, health care, legal relations, IoT, information security, and consensus building systems, only few studies scrutinize the cryptographic concepts used in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, there is no Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) that gives a complete picture of the existing cryptographic concepts which have been deployed or have the potential to be deployed in blockchain. In this paper, we thoroughly review and systematize all cryptographic concepts which are already used in blockchain. Additionally, we give a list of cryptographic concepts which have not yet been applied but have big potentials to improve the current blockchain solutions. We also include possible instantiations of these cryptographic concepts in the blockchain domain. Last but not least, we explicitly postulate 21 challenging problems that cryptographers interested in blockchain can work on.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8865045,IEEE Access,2019,7,,148550-148575,,IEEE,,,2019
Journal Article,"Heimbach L,Wattenhofer R",SoK: Preventing Transaction Reordering Manipulations in Decentralized Finance,"User transactions on Ethereum's peer-to-peer network are at risk of being attacked. The smart contracts building decentralized finance (DeFi) have introduced a new transaction ordering dependency to the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, attackers can profit from front- and back-running transactions. Multiple approaches to mitigate transaction reordering manipulations have surfaced recently. However, the success of individual approaches in mitigating such attacks and their impact on the entire blockchain remains largely unstudied.
In this systematization of knowledge (SoK), we categorize and analyze state-of-the-art transaction reordering manipulation mitigation schemes. Instead of restricting our analysis to a scheme's success at preventing transaction reordering attacks, we evaluate its full impact on the blockchain. Therefore, we are able to provide a complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of current mitigation schemes. We find that currently no scheme fully meets all the demands of the blockchain ecosystem. In fact, all approaches demonstrate unsatisfactory performance in at least one area relevant to the blockchain ecosystem.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11520,arXiv preprint arXiv:2203. 11520,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Zhou L,Xiong X,Ernstberger J,Chaliasos S,Wang Z,Wang Y,Qin K,Wattenhofer R,Song D,Gervais A",SoK: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Incidents,"Within just four years, the blockchain-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem has accumulated a peak total value locked (TVL) of more than 253 billion USD. This surge in DeFi's popularity has, unfortunately, been accompanied by many impactful incidents. According to our data, users, liquidity providers, speculators, and protocol operators suffered a total loss of at least 3.24 USD from Apr 30, 2018 to Apr 30, 2022. Given the blockchain's transparency and increasing incident frequency, two questions arise: How can we systematically measure, evaluate, and compare DeFi incidents? How can we learn from past attacks to strengthen DeFi security?
In this paper, we introduce a common reference frame to systematically evaluate and compare DeFi incidents, including both attacks and accidents. We investigate 77 academic papers, 30 audit reports, and 181 real-world incidents. Our open data reveals several gaps between academia and the practitioners' community. For example, few academic papers address ""price oracle attacks"" and ""permissonless interactions"", while our data suggests that they are the two most frequent incident types (15% and 10.5% correspondingly). We also investigate potential defenses, and find that: (i) 103 (56%) of the attacks are not executed atomically, granting a rescue time frame for defenders; (ii) SoTA bytecode similarity analysis can at least detect 31 vulnerable/23 adversarial contracts; and (iii) 33 (15.3%) of the adversaries leak potentially identifiable information by interacting with centralized exchanges.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13035,arXiv preprint arXiv:2208. 13035,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Kiayias A,Lazos P",SoK: Blockchain Governance,"Blockchain systems come with a promise of decentralization that often stumbles on a roadblock when key decisions about modifying the software codebase need to be made. This is attested by the fact that both of the two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have undergone hard forks that resulted in the creation of alternative systems, creating confusion and opportunities for fraudulent activities. These events, and numerous others, underscore the importance of Blockchain governance, namely the set of processes that blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making and converge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich topic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a well established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide. This makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough systematization that we undertake in this work.
We start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound governance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of election systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven categories, confidentiality, verifiability, accountability, sustainability, Pareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that capture the whole spectrum of desiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented blockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at least one system, no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a foundation for assessing blockchain governance processes. While it highlights shortcomings and deficiencies in currently deployed systems, it can also be a catalyst for improving these processes to the highest possible standard with appropriate trade-offs, something direly needed for blockchain platforms to operate effectively in the long term.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07188,arXiv preprint arXiv:2201. 07188,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Zhang L,Ma X,Liu Y",SoK: Blockchain Decentralization,"Blockchain empowers a decentralized economy by enabling distributed trust in a peer-to-peer network. However, surprisingly, a widely accepted definition or measurement of decentralization is still lacking. We explore a systematization of knowledge (SoK) on blockchain decentralization by comprehensively analyzing existing studies in various aspects. First, we establish a taxonomy for analyzing blockchain decentralization in the five facets of consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction. We find a lack of research on the transaction aspects that closely characterize user behavior. Second, we apply Shannon entropy in information theory to propose a decentralization index for blockchain transactions. We show that our index intuitively measures levels of decentralization in peer-to-peer transactions by simulating blockchain token transfers. Third, we apply our index to empirically analyze the dynamics of DeFi token transfers by three methods of description, prediction, and causal inference. In the descriptive analysis, we observe that levels of decentralization converge inter-temporally, regardless of the initial levels. A comparative study across DeFi applications shows that exchange and lending are more decentralized than payment and derivatives across DeFi applications. Second, in the predictive analysis, we also discover that a greater return of Ether, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain, predicts a greater transaction decentralization in stablecoin that include Ether as collateral. Third, in an event study of causal inference, we find the change of Ethereum Transaction Fee Mechanism to EIP-1559 significantly changes the decentralization level of DeFi transactions. Finally, we identify future research directions.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04256,arXiv preprint arXiv:2205. 04256,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Karakostas D,Kiayias A,Ovezik C",SoK: A Stratified Approach to Blockchain Decentralization,"Decentralization has been touted as the principal security advantage which propelled blockchain systems at the forefront of developments in the financial technology space. Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics (""tokenomics""), (6) API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, points to the degree of (de)centralization of various existing systems, where such assessment can be made from presently available public information, and suggests potential metrics and directions where future research is needed. We also introduce the ""Minimum Decentralization Test"", as a way to assess the decentralization state of a blockchain system and, as an exemplary case, we showcase how it can be applied to Bitcoin.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01291,arXiv preprint arXiv:2211. 01291,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Conference Paper,"Gudgeon L,Moreno-Sanchez P,Roos S,McCorry P,Gervais A",Sok: Layer-two blockchain protocols,"Blockchains have the potential to revolutionize markets and services. However, they currently exhibit high latencies and fail to handle transaction loads comparable to those managed by traditional financial systems. Layer-two protocols, built on top of (layer-one) blockchains, avoid disseminating every transaction to the whole network by exchanging authenticated transactions off-chain. Instead, they utilize the expensive and low-rate blockchain only as a recourse for disputes. The promise of layer-two protocols is to complete off-chain transactions in sub-seconds rather than minutes or hours while retaining asset security, reducing fees and allowing blockchains to scale.

We systematize the evolution of layer-two protocols over the period from the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2009 until today, structuring the multifaceted body of research on layer-two transactions. Categorizing the research into payment and state channels, commit-chains and protocols for refereed delegation, we provide a comparison of the protocols and their properties.

Conference Paper,"Wang G,Shi ZJ,Nixon M,Han S",Sok: Sharding on blockchain,"Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger for recording transactions. It is maintained and shared among the participating nodes by utilizing cryptographic primitives. A consensus protocol ensures that all nodes agree on a unique order in which records are appended. However, current blockchain solutions are facing scalability issues. Many methods, such as Off-chain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) solutions, have been proposed to address the issue. However, they have inherent drawbacks, e.g., forming parasite chains. Performance, such as throughput and latency, is also important to a blockchain system. Sharding has emerged as a good candidate that can overcome both the scalability and performance problems in blockchain. To date, there is no systematic work that analyzes the sharding protocols. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a systematic and comprehensive review on blockchain sharding techniques. We first present a general design flow of sharding protocols and then discuss key design challenges. For each challenge, we analyze and compare the techniques in state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, we discuss several potential research directions in blockchain sharding",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3318041.3355457,,2019,,,41-61,,,,Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Advances in Financial Technologies,2019

Conference Paper,"Chatzigiannis P,Baldimtsi F,Chalkias K",Sok: Blockchain light clients,"Blockchain systems, as append-only ledgers, are typically associated with linearly growing participation costs. Therefore, for a blockchain client to interact with the system (query or submit a transaction), it can either pay these costs by downloading, storing and verifying the blockchain history, or forfeit blockchain security guarantees and place its trust on third party intermediary servers.

With this problem becoming apparent from early works in the blockchain space, the concept of a light client has been proposed, where a resource-constrained client such as a browser or mobile device can participate in the system by querying and/or submitting transactions without holding the full blockchain but while still inheriting the blockchain’s security guarantees. A plethora of blockchain systems with different light client frameworks and implementations have been proposed, each with different functionalities, assumptions and efficiencies. In this work we provide a systematization of such light client designs. We unify the space by providing a set of definitions on their properties in terms of provided functionality, efficiency and security, and provide future research directions based on our findings.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-18283-9_31,,2022,,,615-641,Springer,,,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2022
Journal Article,"Wang Q,Yu J,Chen S,Xiang Y",SoK: Diving into DAG-based blockchain systems,"Blockchain plays an important role in cryptocurrency markets and technology services. However, limitations on high latency and low scalability retard their adoptions and applications in classic designs. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently re-build upper layer components including consensus, incentives, \textit{etc.} The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises the DAG technique. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of DAG-based blockchain systems. Through deconstructing open-sourced systems and reviewing academic researches, we conclude the main components and featured properties of systems, and provide the approach to establish a DAG. With this in hand, we analyze the security and performance of several leading systems, followed by discussions and comparisons with concurrent (scaling blockchain) techniques.

Journal Article,"Li R,Wang Q,Wang Q,Galindo D,Ryan M",SoK: TEE-assisted Confidential Smart Contract,"The blockchain-based smart contract lacks privacy since the contract state and instruction code are exposed to the public. Combining smart-contract execution with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provides an efficient solution, called TEE-assisted smart contracts, for protecting the confidentiality of contract states. However, the combination approaches are varied, and a systematic study is absent. Newly released systems may fail to draw upon the experience learned from existing protocols, such as repeating known design mistakes or applying TEE technology in insecure ways. In this paper, we first investigate and categorize the existing systems into two types: the layer-one solution and layer-two solution. Then, we establish an analysis framework to capture their common lights, covering the desired properties (for contract services), threat models, and security considerations (for underlying systems). Based on our taxonomy, we identify their ideal functionalities and uncover the fundamental flaws and reasons for the challenges in each specification design.

While by design, blockchains provide no means to securely communicate with external systems, numerous attempts towards trustless cross-chain communication have been proposed over the years. Today, cross-chain communication (CCC) plays a fundamental role in cryptocurrency exchanges, scalability efforts via sharding, extension of existing systems through sidechains, and bootstrapping of new blockchains. Unfortunately, existing proposals are designed ad-hoc for specific use-cases, making it hard to gain confidence in their correctness and composability. We provide the first systematic exposition of cross-chain communication protocols.

We formalize the underlying research problem and show that CCC is impossible without a trusted third party, contrary to common beliefs in the blockchain community. With this result in mind, we develop a framework to design new and evaluate existing CCC protocols, focusing on the inherent trust assumptions thereof, and derive a classification covering the field of cross-chain communication to date.

Conference Paper,"Bartoletti M,Chiang JH,Lafuente AL",SoK: lending pools in decentralized finance,"Lending pools are decentralized applications which allow mutually untrusted users to lend and borrow crypto-assets. These applications feature complex, highly parametric incentive mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This complexity makes the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to predict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could potentially lead to emergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning about lending pools is made even harder by the lack of executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand how users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to inspect their implementations, where the incentive mechanisms are intertwined with low-level implementation details. Further, the variety of existing implementations makes it difficult to distill the common aspects of lending pools. We systematize the existing knowledge about lending pools, leveraging a new formal model of interactions with users, which reflects the archetypal features of mainstream implementations. This enables us to prove some general properties of lending pools, and to precisely describe vulnerabilities and attacks. We also discuss the role of lending pools in the broader context of decentralized finance and identify relevant research challenges.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_40,,2021,,,553-578,Springer,,,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2021

To facilitate the improvement and development of automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general automated market maker (AMM) framework describing the economics and formalizing the system's state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top automated market maker (AMM) protocols' mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions.

Complementary features between blockchain and auction models trigger a great potential for research and innovation. On the one hand, the decentralized nature of blockchain can provide a trustworthy, secure, and cost-effective mechanism to manage the auction process; on the other hand, auction models can be utilized to design incentive and consensus protocols in blockchain architectures. These opportunities have attracted enormous research and innovation activities in both academia and industry; however, there is a lack of an in-depth review of existing solutions and achievements. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey of these two research topics.

Despite great attention and benefits, a natural question in the metaverse is how to secure its users' digital content and data. In this regard, blockchain is a promising solution owing to its distinct features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we aim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the metaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and highlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next, we extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from technical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing, data interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we first discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how blockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on key-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things, digital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial intelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the role of blockchain in metaverse applications and services. Finally, we present some promising directions to drive further research innovations and developments towards the use of blockchain in the metaverse in the future.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09738,arXiv preprint arXiv:2203. 09738,2022,,,,,,,,2022

In ideal terms, blockchain advocates a decentralized, transparent, and more democratic version of the Internet. Essentially being a trusted and decentralized database, blockchain finds its applications in fields as varied as the energy sector, forestry, fisheries, mining, material recycling, air pollution monitoring, supply chain management, and their associated operations. In this paper, we present a survey of blockchain-based network applications. Our goal is to cover the evolution of blockchain-based systems that are trying to bring in a renaissance in the existing, mostly centralized, space of network applications. While re-imagining the space with blockchain, we highlight various common challenges, pitfalls, and shortcomings that can occur.

Journal Article,"Ruoti S,Kaiser B,Yerukhimovich A,Clark J,Cunningham R",SoK: Blockchain technology and its potential use cases,"Bitcoin's success has led to significant interest in its underlying components, particularly Blockchain technology. Over 10 years after Bitcoin's initial release, the community still suffers from a lack of clarity regarding what properties defines Blockchain technology, its relationship to similar technologies, and which of its proposed use-cases are tenable and which are little more than hype. In this paper we answer four common questions regarding Blockchain technology: (1) what exactly is Blockchain technology, (2) what capabilities does it provide, and (3) what are good applications for Blockchain technology, and (4) how does it relate to other approache distributed technologies (e.g., distributed databases). We accomplish this goal by using grounded theory (a structured approach to gathering and analyzing qualitative data) to thoroughly analyze a large corpus of literature on Blockchain technology. This method enables us to answer the above questions while limiting researcher bias, separating thought leadership from peddled hype and identifying open research questions related to Blockchain technology. The audience for this paper is broad as it aims to help researchers in a variety of areas come to a better understanding of Blockchain technology and identify whether it may be of use in their own research.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12454,arXiv preprint arXiv:1909. 12454,2019,,,,,,,,2019

Journal Article,"Ankele R,Nahrgang K,Stojanovic B,Badii A",SoK: Cyber-Attack Taxonomy of Distributed Ledger-and Legacy Systems-based Financial Infrastructures,"Nowadays, virtually all products and services offered by financial institutions are backed by technology. While the frontend banking services seem to be simple, the core-banking backend systems and architecture are complex and often based on legacy technologies. Customer-facing applications and services are evolving rapidly, yet they have data dependencies on core banking systems running on ancient technology standards.

While those legacy systems are preferred for their stability, reliability, availability, and security properties, in adapting the frontends and services many security and privacy issues can occur. Clearly, this issues are arising as those systems have been designed decades ago, without considering the enormous amounts of data that they are required to handle and also considering different threat scenarios. Moreover, the trend towards using new technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) has also emerged in the financial sector. As the nodes in DLT systems are decentralized, additional security threats come to light.

The focus of this work is the security of financial technologies in the FinTech domain. We provide relevant categorization and taxonomies for a better understanding of the main cyber-attack types, and suitable countermeasures. Our findings are supported by using security-by-design principles for some selected critical financial use-cases, and include a detailed discussion of the resulting threats, attack vectors and security recommendations.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1440,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2020,,,,,,,,2020
Journal Article,"Yang S,Zhang F,Huang K,Chen X,Yang Y,Zhu F",SoK: MEV Countermeasures: Theory and Practice,"Blockchains offer strong security guarantees, but they cannot protect the ordering of transactions. Powerful players, such as miners, sequencers, and sophisticated bots, can reap significant profits by selectively including, excluding, or re-ordering user transactions. Such profits are called Miner/Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. MEV bears profound implications for blockchain security and decentralization. While numerous countermeasures have been proposed, there is no agreement on the best solution. Moreover, solutions developed in academic literature differ quite drastically from what is widely adopted by practitioners. For these reasons, this paper systematizes the knowledge of the theory and practice of MEV countermeasures. The contribution is twofold. First, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of 28 proposed MEV countermeasures, covering four different technical directions. Secondly, we empirically studied the most popular MEV- auction-based solution with rich blockchain and mempool data. In addition to gaining insights into MEV auction platforms' real-world operations, our study shed light on the prevalent censorship by MEV auction platforms as a result of the recent OFAC sanction, and its implication on blockchain properties.

In addition, there is little systematic research on these projects. In this paper, we delineate play-to-earn projects in terms of economic & governance models and implementation and analyze how blockchain technology can benefit these projects by providing system robustness, transparency, composability, and decentralized governance. We begin by identifying the participants and characterizing the tokens, which are products of composability. We then summarize the roadmap and governance model to exposit there is a transition from centralized governance to decentralized governance.

Journal Article,"Azouvi S,Hicks A",Sok: Tools for game theoretic models of security for cryptocurrencies,"Cryptocurrencies have garnered much attention in recent years, both from the academic community and industry. One interesting aspect of cryptocurrencies is their explicit consideration of incentives at the protocol level, which has motivated a large body of work—yet many open problems still exist, and current systems rarely deal with incentive related problems well. This issue arises due to the gap between cryptography and distributed systems security, which deals with traditional security problems that ignore the explicit consideration of incentives, and game theory, which deals best with situations involving incentives. With this work, we offer a systematization of the work that relates to this problem, considering papers that blend game theory with cryptography or distributed systems. This gives an overview of the available tools, and we look at their (potential) use in practice in the context of existing blockchain-based systems that have been proposed or implemented.",https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/azouvi-sok-security,arXiv preprint arXiv:1905. 08595,2019,,,,,,,,2019
Conference Paper,"Bellaj B,Ouaddah A,Bertin E,Crespi N,Mezrioui A",SOK: a comprehensive survey on distributed ledger technologies,"In recent years, Blockchain arose as a key technology in building autonomous decentralised financial systems. Its ability to digitize trust enables building trustless systems such as cryptocurrencies where users do not need to rely on any third party to exchange value. The success of cryptocurrencies to operate without any intermediaries draw the interest of business operators who seek to bypass intermediation and thus to reduce cost and gain competitive advantages. As a result, Blockchain was used outside the crypto-sphere to build decentralized systems. However, this portage led to the inception of new types of Blockchains adapted to different specifications and with different designs. Consequently, the technology has diverged from its baseline (Bitcoin) to the point where some systems marketed as “blockchain” share only a few design concepts with the original Blockchain design proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. This conceptual divergence alongside the lack of comprehensive models and standards made it difficult for both system designers and decision-makers to clearly understand what is a blockchain or to choose a suitable solution.This survey has a double goal; on the one hand, it attempts to contribute to the discussion on the ontological status of DLTs by providing a taxonomy oriented-framework (DCEA) for conceptualizing and examining DLT. On the other hand, it also attempts to present an up-to-date review and evaluation of current blockchains and their variants as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9805533,,2022,,,16-Jan,IEEE,,,ICBC 2022: IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency,2022

Since smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value, besides their correct execution it is also crucial that their implementation is secure against attacks which aim at stealing or tampering the assets. We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far.

Bribing and other related attacks, such as front-running or Goldfinger attacks, aim to directly influence the incentives of actors within (or outside) of the targeted cryptocurrency system. The theoretical possibility of bribing attacks on cryptocurrencies was discussed early on in the cryptocurrency community and various different techniques and approaches have since been proposed. Some of these attacks are designed to gain in-band profits, while others intend to break the mechanism design and render the cryptocurrency worthless. In this paper, we systematically expose the large but scattered body of research in this area which has accumulated over the years. We summarize these bribing attacks and similar techniques that leverage on programmatic execution and verification under the term algorithmic incentive manipulation (AIM) attacks, and show that the problem space is not yet fully explored. Based on our analysis we present several research gaps and opportunities that warrant further investigation. In particular, we highlight no- and near-fork attacks as a powerful, yet largely underestimated, AIM category that raises serious security concerns not only for smart contract platforms.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_38,,2021,,,507-532,Springer,,,International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security,2021
Conference Paper,"Di Angelo M,Sack C,Salzer G",SoK: Development of secure smart contracts--lessons from a graduate course,"Smart contracts are programs on top of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. This new technology allows parties to exchange valuable assets without mutual trust, with smart contracts controlling the interaction between the parties. Developing smart contracts, or more generally decentralized applications, is challenging. First, they run in a concurrent environment that admits race conditions; adversaries may attack smart contracts by influencing the order of transactions. Second, the required functionality is often based on roles and states. This proves to be difficult to implement in current smart contract languages. Third, as a distinctive feature, smart contracts are immutable, hence bugs cannot be corrected easily. At the same time, bugs may cause (and have already caused) tremendous losses; they are to be avoided by all means.

This paper discusses our approach of teaching the development of secure smart contracts on the Ethereum platform at university level. This is a challenging task in many respects. The underlying technologies evolve rapidly and documentation lags behind. Available tools are in different stages of development, and even the most mature ones are still difficult to use. The development of secure smart contracts is not yet a well-established discipline.

The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void.

Journal Article,"Raikwar M,Gligoroski D",SoK: Decentralized Randomness Beacon Protocols,"The scientific interest in the area of Decentralized Randomness Beacon (DRB) protocols has been thriving recently. Partially that interest is due to the success of the disruptive technologies introduced by modern cryptography, such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and decentralized finances, where there is an enormous need for a public, reliable, trusted, verifiable, and distributed source of randomness. On the other hand, recent advancements in the development of new cryptographic primitives brought a huge interest in constructing a plethora of DRB protocols differing in design and underlying primitives.
To the best of our knowledge, no systematic and comprehensive work systematizes and analyzes the existing DRB protocols. Therefore, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) intending to structure the multi-faced body of research on DRB protocols. In this SoK, we delineate the DRB protocols along the following axes: their underlying primitive, properties, and security. This SoK tries to fill that gap by providing basic standard definitions and requirements for DRB protocols, such as Unpredictability, Bias-resistance, Availability (or Liveness), and Public Verifiability.

Journal Article,"Rinberg R,Agarwal N",Privacy when Everyone is Watching: An SOK on Anonymity on the Blockchain,"Blockchain technologies rely on a public ledger, where typically all transactions are pseudoanonymous and fully traceable. This poses a major flaw in its large scale adoption of cryptocurrencies, the primary application of blockchain technologies, as most individuals do not want to disclose their finances to the public. Motivated by the explosive growth in private-Blockchain research, this Statement-of-Knowledge (SOK) explores the ways to obtain privacy in this public ledger ecosystem. The authors first look at the underlying technology underling all zero-knowledge applications on the blockchain: zk-SNARKs (z S uccinct N on-interactive AR guments of K ero-k nowledge nowledge). We then explore the two largest privacy coins as of today, ZCash and Monero, as well as TornadoCash, a popular Ethereum Tumbler solution. Finally, we look at the opposing incentives behind privacy solutions and de-anonymization techniques, and the future of privacy on the blockchain.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/985,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Jourenko M,Kurazumi K,Larangeira M,Tanaka K",SoK: A taxonomy for layer-2 scalability related protocols for cryptocurrencies,"Blockchain based systems, in particular cryptocurrencies, face a serious limitation: scalability. This holds, especially, in terms of number of transactions per second.
Several alternatives are currently being pursued by both the research and practitioner communities. One venue for exploration is on protocols that  do not constantly add transactions on the blockchain and therefore do not consume the blockchain's resources. This is done using off-chain transactions, i.e., protocols that minimize the interaction with the blockchain, also commonly known as  Layer-2 approaches.
This work relates several existing off-chain channel methods, also known as  payment and state channels, channel network constructions methods, and other components as channel and network management protocols, e.g., routing nodes.  All these components are crucial to keep the usability of the channel, and are often overlooked. For the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a taxonomy for all the components of the Layer-2. We provide an extensive coverage on the state-of-art protocols  available. We also  outline their respective approaches, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/352,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2019,,,,,,,,2019
Journal Article,"Bonomi S,Del Pozzo A,Garc√≠a-P√©rez √Å,Tucci-Piergiovanni S",SoK: Achieving State Machine Replication in Blockchains based on Repeated Consensus,"This paper revisits the ubiquitous problem of achieving state machine replication in blockchains based on repeated consensus, like Tendermint. To achieve state machine replication in blockchains built on top of consensus, one needs to guarantee fairness of user transactions. A huge body of work has been carried out on the relation between state machine replication and consensus in the past years, in a variety of system models and with respect to varied problem specifications. We systematize this work by proposing novel and rigorous abstractions for state machine replication and repeated consensus in a system model that accounts for realistic blockchains in which blocks may contain several transactions issued by one or more users, and where validity and order of transactions within a block is determined by an external application-dependent function that can capture various approaches for order-fairness in the literature. Based on these abstractions, we propose a reduction from state machine replication to repeated consensus, such that user fairness is achieved using the consensus module as a black box. This approach allows to achieve fairness as an add-on on top of preexisting consensus modules in blockchains based on repeated consensus.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13732,arXiv preprint arXiv:2105. 13732,2021,,,,,,,,2021
Conference Paper,"Kolachala K,Simsek E,Ababneh M,Vishwanathan R",SoK: Money Laundering in Cryptocurrencies,"Money laundering using cryptocurrencies has become increasingly prevalent, and global and national regulatory authorities have announced plans to implement stringent anti-money laundering regulations. In this paper, we examine current anti-money laundering (AML) mechanisms in cryptocurrencies and payment networks from a technical and policy perspective, and point out practical challenges in implementing and enforcing them. We first discuss blacklisting, a recently proposed technique to combat money laundering, which seems appealing, but leaves several unanswered questions and challenges with regard to its enforcement. We then discuss payment networks and find that there are unique problems in the payment network domain that might require custom-designed AML solutions, as opposed to general cryptocurrency AML techniques. Finally, we examine the regulatory guidelines and recommendations as laid out by the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and the U.S. based Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and find that there are several ambiguities in their interpretation and implementation. To quantify the effects of money laundering, we conduct experiments on real-world transaction datasets. Our goal in this paper is to survey the landscape of existing AML mechanisms, and focus the attention of the research community on this issue. Our findings indicate the community must endeavor to treat AML regulations and technical methods as an integral part of the systems they build and must strive to design solutions from the ground up that respect AML regulatory frameworks. We hope that this paper will serve as a point of reference for researchers that wish to build systems with AML mechanisms, and will help them understand the challenges that lie ahead.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3465481.3465774,,2021,,,10-Jan,,,,"The 16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security",2021
Journal Article,"Ghesmati S,Fdhila W,Weippl E",SoK: How private is Bitcoin? Classification and Evaluation of Bitcoin Mixing Techniques,"Blockchain is a disruptive technology that promises a multitude of benefits, such as transparency, traceability, and immutability. However, this unique bundle of key characteristics has proved to be a double-edged sword that can put users’ privacy at risk. Unlike in traditional systems, Bitcoin transactions are publicly and permanently recorded, and anyone can access the full history of the records. Despite using pseudonymous identities, an adversary can undermine users’ financial privacy and reveal their actual identities by using advanced heuristics and techniques to identify possible links between transactions, senders, receivers, and consumed services (e.g., online purchases). Hence, a multitude of approaches has been proposed to reduce financial transparency and enhance users’ anonymity. These techniques range from mixing services to off-chain transactions that address different privacy issues. In this paper, we particularly focus on comparing and evaluating privacy techniques in the Bitcoin blockchain (which can be applied in (Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) based blockchains), present their limitations, and highlight new challenges.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3538969.3538971,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2021,,,,,,,,2021
Journal Article,"Lande S,Zunino R",SoK: unraveling Bitcoin smart contracts,"Albeit the primary usage of Bitcoin is to exchange currency, its blockchain and consensus mechanism can also be exploited to securely execute some forms of smart contracts. These are agreements among mutually distrusting parties, which can be automatically enforced without resorting to a trusted intermediary. Over the last few years a variety of smart contracts for Bitcoin have been proposed, both by the academic community and by that of developers. However, the heterogeneity in their treatment, the informal (often incomplete or imprecise) descriptions, and the use of poorly documented Bitcoin features, pose obstacles to the research. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of smart contracts on Bitcoin, in a uniform framework. Our treatment is based on a new formal specification language for smart contracts, which also helps us to highlight some subtleties in existing informal descriptions, making a step towards automatic verification. We discuss some obstacles to the diffusion of smart contracts on Bitcoin, and we identify the most promising open research challenges.",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_9,Principles of Security and Trust LNCS,2018,10804,,217,,,,,2018
Journal Article,"Casino F,Pina C,L√≥pez-Aguilar P,Batista E,Solanas A,Patsakis C",SoK: Cross-border Criminal Investigations and Digital Evidence,"
Digital evidence underpin the majority of crimes as their analysis is an integral part of almost every criminal investigation. Even if we temporarily disregard the numerous challenges in the collection and analysis of digital evidence, the exchange of the evidence among the different stakeholders has many thorny issues. Of specific interest are cross-border criminal investigations as the complexity is significantly high due to the heterogeneity of legal frameworks, which beyond time bottlenecks can also become prohibiting. The aim of this article is to analyse the current state of practice of cross-border investigations considering the efficacy of current collaboration protocols along with the challenges and drawbacks to be overcome. Further to performing a legally oriented research treatise, we recall all the challenges raised in the literature and discuss them from a more practical yet global perspective. Thus, this article paves the way to enabling practitioners and stakeholders to leverage horizontal strategies to fill in the identified gaps timely and accurately.",https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/8/1/tyac014/6909060,arXiv preprint arXiv:2205. 12911,2022,,,,,,,,2022
Journal Article,"Deuber D,Ronge V,R√ºckert C",SoK: Assumptions Underlying Cryptocurrency Deanonymizations--A Taxonomy for Scientific Experts and Legal Practitioners,"In recent years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly been used in cybercrime and have become the key means of payment in darknet marketplaces, partly due to their alleged anonymity. Furthermore, the research attacking the anonymity of even those cryptocurrencies that claim to offer anonymity by design is growing and is being applied by law enforcement agencies in the fight against cybercrime. Their investigative measures require a certain degree of suspicion and it is unclear whether findings resulting from attacks on cryptocurrencies' anonymity can indeed establish that required degree of suspicion. The reason for this is that these attacks are partly based upon uncertain assumptions which are often not properly addressed in the corresponding papers. To close this gap, we extract the assumptions in papers that are attacking Bitcoin, Monero and Zcash, major cryptocurrencies used in darknet markets which have also received the most attention from researchers. We develop a taxonomy to capture the different nature of those assumptions in order to help investigators to better assess whether the required degree of suspicion for specific investigative measures could be established. We found that assumptions based on user behaviour are in general the most unreliable and thus any findings of attacks based on them might not allow for intense investigative measures such as pre-trial detention. We hope to raise awareness of the problem so that in the future there will be fewer unlawful investigations based upon uncertain assumptions and thus fewer human rights violations.",https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/763,Cryptology ePrint Archive,2022,,,,,,,,2022

Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain, achieves great success and promotes more development in this field. However, Bitcoin encounters performance problems of low throughput and high transaction latency. Other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work also inherit the flaws, leading to more concerns about the scalability of blockchain.

Journal Article,"Franzoni F,Daza V",SoK: Network-Level Attacks on the Bitcoin P2P Network,"Over the last decade, Bitcoin has revolutionized the global economic and technological landscape, inspiring a new generation of blockchain-based technologies. Its protocol is today among the most influential for cryptocurrencies and distributed networks. In particular, the P2P layer represents a reference point for all permissionless blockchains, which often implement its solutions in their network layer. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network protocol lacks a strong security model, leaving it exposed to several threats. Attacks at this level can affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the consensus layer, mining the credibility of the whole system. It is therefore of utmost importance to properly understand and address the security of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed overview of known network-level attacks in Bitcoin, as well as the countermeasures that have been implemented in the protocol. We propose a generic network adversary model, and propose an objective-based taxonomy of the attacks. Finally, we identify the core weaknesses of the protocol and study the relationship between different types of attack. We believe our contribution can help both new and experienced researchers have a broader and deeper understanding of the Bitcoin P2P network and its threats, and allow for a better modeling of its security properties.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9877811,IEEE Access,2022,10,,94924-94962,,IEEE,,,2022
