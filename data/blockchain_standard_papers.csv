"Comparing Blockchain Standards
and Recommendations","Since the introduction of Bitcoin, the term “blockchain” has attracted many start-ups and
companies over the years, especially in the financial sector. However, technology is evolving faster
than standardization frameworks. This left the industry in the position of having to use this emerging
technology, without being backed by any international standards organization regarding for neither
the technology itself, nor for a blockchain specific information security framework. In times of the
General Data Protection Regulation and growing international trade conflicts, protecting information
is more relevant than ever. Standardization of blockchains is an appeal to raise the development
of information technologies to the next level. Therefore, this paper shall provide an overview
of standardization organization’s publications about blockchains/distributed ledger technologies,
a set of comparison criteria for future work and a comparison of the existing standards work itself.
With that information, aligning to existing standardization efforts becomes easier, and might even
present the possibility to create frameworks where there are none at the moment.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/12/222/pdf,
Blockchain Standards for Compliance and Trust,"Blockchain methods are emerging as practical tools for validation, record-keeping, and access control in addition to their early applications in cryptocurrency. This column explores the options for use of blockchains to enhance security, trust, and compliance in a variety of industry settings and explores the current state of blockchain standards. Cryptocurrency applications of distributed ledger methods such as blockchains are now well established, but their implications for more general topics are just beginning to be appreciated. Beyond applications in finance and banking, new applications are emerging in supply chain management, manufacturing, agricultural product tracking, advertising verification, Internet of Things, healthcare, and the pharmaceutical industry, among others.",https://anjum.web.cern.ch/papers/d4sta.pdf,
Global Standards  Mapping Initiative:  An overview of blockchain technical standards,"As blockchain technology continues its evolution, calls for clarity surrounding technical, regulatory and governance models have grown louder. Decisions on these foundational elements will shape the trajectory and potential of the technology. However, there has been little work to catalogue and evaluate the current bedrock upon which the ecosystem can build, despite the increased activity in each of these arenas. As actors across the world construct innovative solutions to address society’s toughest challenges, a baseline is needed to facilitate impactful and responsible innovation. Cataloguing the status of dozens of standardsetting entities and consortia plus regulations across 129 countries, the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI) represents an unprecedented effort to map and analyse the current landscape. It is divided into two distinct components: 1. Technical standards 2. Legislation and guidance released by sovereign and international bodies and industry body best practices and standards (including an overview of industry groups and consortia) The work was a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and the Global Blockchain Business Council, with significant contributions from the MIT Media Lab, ING, Accenture, SDX and the Milken Institute. This cross-organizational effort was a truly global collaboration, as well as an alignment of previously disparate initiatives. We hope this will serve as a model for future ecosystem-wide efforts of a similar nature. These reports are intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the blockchain community and beyond to assess the current landscape and evaluate where there may be gaps, overlaps, inconsistencies and conflicts.",https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/global-standards-mapping-initiative-an-overview-of-blockchain-technical-standards,https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_AppendixA_Reference_architecture_comparison.pdf
A Web-based Ledger Data Model and Format: A position statement by Digital Bazaar for the W3C Blockchain Workshop,"Decentralized ledgers (aka blockchains) have been designed for decentralized control but not for decentralized semantics. They are highly specific to their application area and lack the flexibility required for a variety of different storage and provenance models. They possess no mechanism for extending their data model in a self-discoverable or machine-readable way. This makes tuning the existing monolithic blockchain designs to meet new use cases a challenging, if not financially and technically prohibitive, undertaking.
If we assume that there will be many different types of ledgers, as there are many different types of websites today, then it follows that a generalized format for expressing and accessing these ledgers is desirable and a requirement for interoperability. We currently don’t have the equivalent of JSON or HTTP for Blockchains. Creating a generalized Web-based ledger data model, format, and protocol would commoditize the data model and format while spurring innovation at the application layer.

Linked Data Indexing of Distributed Ledgers,"Searching for information in distributed ledgers is currently not an easy task, as information relating to an entity may be scattered throughout the ledger with no index. As distributed ledger technologies become more established, they will increasingly be used to represent real world transactions involving many parties and the search requirements will grow. An index providing the ability to search using domain specific terms across multiple ledgers will greatly enhance to power, usability and scope of these systems. We have implemented a semantic index to the Ethereum blockchain platform, to expose distributed ledger data as Linked Data. As well as indexing block- and transactionlevel data according to the BLONDiE ontology, we have mapped smart contracts to the Minimal Service Model ontology, to take the first steps towards connecting smart contracts with Semantic Web Services.",http://oro.open.ac.uk/49736/1/p1431.pdf,
Developing Open and Interoperable DLT\/Blockchain Standards ,"Reports on the development of Open and Interoperable Distributed Ledger Technology/Blockchain standards. Discusses how these standards drive global blockchain adoption and take development of the technology ecosystem to the next level. The field of blockchain or distributed ledger is growing rapidly. The lack of consensus on definitions, implementation, management, and core attributes is driving the need for standardization. Blockchain is often confused with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but the potential applications of this technology in diverse fields, such as smart contracts, buying and selling energy, and so much more, make distributed ledger technologies one of the high-potential technologies for the future.",https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2018/11/08625908/17D45XfSEUx,
