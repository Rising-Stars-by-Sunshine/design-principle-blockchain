1,Bitcoin ,BTC,2009,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/,https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf,Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The network itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."
2,Ethereum,ETH,2015,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/,https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/,Ethereum Whitepaper: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform,"Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or ""intrinsic value"" and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments (""colored coins""), the ownership of an underlying physical device (""smart property""), non-fungible assets such as domain names (""Namecoin""), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules (""smart contracts"") or even blockchain-based ""decentralized autonomous organizations"" (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create ""contracts"" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code."
3,Binance smart chain,BNB,2017,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bnb/,https://github.com/binance-chain/whitepaper/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md,BNB Smart Chain: A Parallel Blockchain to Beacon Chain to Enable Smart Contracts,"After its mainnet community launch in April 2019, Beacon Chain has exhibited its high speed and large throughput design. Beacon Chain’s primary focus, its native decentralized application (“dApp”) Binance DEX, has demonstrated its low-latency matching with large capacity headroom by handling millions of trading volume in a short time.

Flexibility and usability are often in an inverse relationship with performance. The concentration on providing a convenient digital asset issuing and trading venue also brings limitations. Beacon Chain's most requested feature is the programmable extendibility, or simply the Smart Contract and Virtual Machine functions. Digital asset issuers and owners struggle to add new decentralized features for their assets or introduce any sort of community governance and activities.

Despite this high demand for adding the Smart Contract feature onto Beacon Chain, it is a hard decision to make. The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. If that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of Beacon Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

We propose a parallel blockchain of the current Beacon Chain to retain the high performance of the native DEX blockchain and to support a friendly Smart Contract function at the same time."
4,XRP Ledger (Ripple),XRP,2021,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/,https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf,The Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm," While several consensus algorithms exist for the Byzantine Generals Problem, specifically as it pertains to distributed payment systems, many suffer from high latency induced by the requirement that all nodes within the network communicate synchronously. In this work, we present a novel consensus algorithm that circumvents this requirement by utilizing collectively-trusted subnetworks within the larger network. We show that the “trust” required of these subnetworks is in fact minimal and can be further reduced with principled choice of the member nodes. In addition, we show that minimal connectivity is required to maintain agreement throughout the whole network. The result is a low-latency consensus algorithm which still maintains robustness in the face of Byzantine failures. We present this algorithm in its embodiment in the Ripple Protocol"
5,Cardano,ADA,2017,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/,https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/,"Why Cardano: The original essay for 2017 outlining the background, philosophy and inspiration behind the Cardano blockchain","Cardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform and home to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.
The Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an industry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields of blockchain and cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and transparency. It is a fully open source project that aims to deliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and social applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring reliable, secure financial services to those people who do not currently have access.
Cardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is written in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language like Haskell, building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation. Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable us to employ a whole range of powerful methods for ensuring correctness of the code, such as basing the implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed and will serve as a stable and secure platform for the development of enterprise-level dApps. In the near future, Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself in a sustainable way through a visionary treasury system."
6,Polkadot,DOT,2022,Cross-chain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/,https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf,Polkadot: vision for a heterogenous multi-chain framework,"Present-day blockchain architectures all suffer from a number of issues not least practical means of extensibility and scalability. We believe this stems from tying two very important parts of the consensus architecture, namely canonicality and validity, too closely together. This paper introduces an architecture, the heterogeneous multi-chain, which fundamentally sets the two apart. In compartmentalising these two parts, and by keeping the overall functionality provided to an absolute minimum of security and transport, we introduce practical means of core extensibility in situ. Scalability is addressed through a divide-and-conquer approach to these two functions, scaling out of its bonded core through the incentivisation of untrusted public nodes. The heterogeneous nature of this architecture enables many highly divergent types of consensus systems interoperating in a trustless, fully decentralised “federation”, allowing open and closed networks to have trust-free access to each other. We put forward a means of providing backwards compatibility with one or more pre-existing networks such as Ethereum. We believe that such a system provides a useful base-level component in the overall search for a practically implementable system capable of achieving global-commerce levels of scalability and privacy."
7,TRON,TRX,2017,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/,https://tron.network/static/doc/white_paper_v_2_0.pdf,TRON: Advanced Decentralized Blockchain Platform,"TRON is an open source public blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. TRON is compatible with Ethereum, which means that you can migrate smart contracts on Ethereum to TRON directly or with minor modifications. TRON relies on a unique consensus mechanism to realize the high TPS of the TRON network that is far beyond Ethereum, bringing developers a good experience of a faster transaction."
8,Solana,SOL,2020,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/,https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf,Solana: A new architecture for a high performance blockchain v0.8.13,"This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof of History (PoH)- a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events. PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger- an append only data structure. When used alongside a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant replicated state machine, resulting inn sub-second finality times. This paper also proposes two algorithms that leverage the time keeping properties of the PoH ledger- a PoS algorithm that can recover from partitions of any size and an efficient streaming Proof of Replication (PoRep). The combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense against forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and storage. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and this paper shows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible with todays hardware."
9,Avalanche,AVAX,2020,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/,https://assets.website-files.com/5d80307810123f5ffbb34d6e/6008d7bc56430d6b8792b8d1_Avalanche%20Native%20Token%20Dynamics.pdf,Avalanche Native Token ($AVAX) Dynamics,"This paper discusses the key implementation details, in particular the token economics (tokenomics), of the native token of the Avalanche platform, called $AVAX. The native token secures the network, pays for fees, and provides the basic unit of account between the multiple blockchains deployed on the larger Avalanche network. For additional details on Avalanche, which serves as a versatile and universal platform, allowing anyone to launch new blockchains with their own rules, virtual machines, and validator sets, we guide the reader to either the accompanying architectural paper [1] or the Avalanche docs [2]."
10,Chainlink,LINK,2017,Cross-chain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/,https://chain.link/whitepaper,Chainlink 2.0: Next Steps in the Evolution of Decentralized Oracle Networks,"In this whitepaper, we articulate a vision for the evolution of Chainlink beyond its initial conception in the original Chainlink whitepaper. We foresee an increasingly expansive role for oracle networks, one in which they complement and enhance existing and new blockchains by providing fast, reliable, and confidentiality-preserving universal connectivity and off-chain computation for smart contracts. The foundation of our plan is what we call Decentralized Oracle Networks, or DONs for short. A DON is a network maintained by a committee of Chainlink nodes. It supports any of an unlimited range of oracle functions chosen for deployment by the committee. A DON thus acts as a powerful abstraction layer, offering interfaces for smart contracts to extensive off-chain resources and highly efficient yet decentralized off-chain computing resources within the DON itself. With DONs as a springboard, Chainlink plans to focus on advances in seven key areas: Hybrid smart contracts: Offering a powerful, general framework for augmenting existing smart contract capabilities by securely composing on-chain and off-chain computing resources into what we call hybrid smart contracts. Abstracting away complexity: Presenting developers and users with simple functionality eliminates the need for familiarity with complex underlying protocols and system boundaries. Scaling: Ensuring that oracle services achieve the latencies and throughputs demanded by high-performance decentralized systems. Confidentiality: Enabling next-generation systems that combine blockchains’ innate transparency with strong new confidentiality protections for sensitive data. Order-fairness for transactions: Supporting transaction sequencing in ways that are fair for end users and prevent front-running and other attacks by bots and exploitative miners. Trust-minimization: Creating a highly trustworthy layer of support for smart contracts and other oracle-dependent systems by means of decentralization, strong anchoring in high-security blockchains, cryptographic techniques, and cryptoeconomic guarantees. Incentive-based (cryptoeconomic) security: Rigorously designing and robustly deploying mechanisms that ensure nodes in DONs have strong economic incentives to behave reliably and correctly, even in the face of wellresourced adversaries. Wepresent preliminary and ongoing innovations by the Chainlink community in each of these areas, providing a picture of the broadening and increasingly powerful capabilities planned for the Chainlink network."
11,The Open Network (TON),TON,2018,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/,https://tron.network/static/doc/white_paper_v_2_0.pdf,The Open Network,"The aim of this text is to provide a first description of the The Open Network (TON) and related blockchain, peer-to-peer, distributed storage and service hosting technologies. To reduce the size of this document to reasonable proportions, we focus mainly on the unique and dening features of the TON platform that are important for it to achieve its stated goals. The Open Network (TON) is a fast, secure and scalable blockchain and network project, capable of handling millions of transactions per second if necessary, and both user-friendly and service provider-friendly. We aim for it to be able to host all reasonable applications currently proposed and conceived. One might think about TON as a huge distributed supercomputer, or rather a huge superserver, intended to host and provide a variety of services."
12,Cosmos,ATOM,2016,Cross-chain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/,https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper,Cosmos Whitepaper: A Network of Distributed Ledgers,"The combined success of the open-source ecosystem, decentralized file-sharing, and public cryptocurrencies has inspired an understanding that decentralized internet protocols can be used to radically improve socio-economic infrastructure. We have seen specialized blockchain applications like Bitcoin [1] (a cryptocurrency), Zerocash [2] (a cryptocurrency for privacy), and generalized smart contract platforms such as Ethereum [3], with countless distributed applications for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Augur (a prediction market) and TheDAO [4] (an investment club).
To date, however, these blockchains have suffered from a number of drawbacks, including their gross energy inefficiency, poor or limited performance, and immature governance mechanisms. Proposals to scale Bitcoin’s transaction throughput, such as Segregated-Witness [5] and BitcoinNG [6], are vertical scaling solutions that remain limited by the capacity of a single physical machine, in order to ensure the property of complete auditability. The Lightning Network [7] can help scale Bitcoin transaction volume by leaving some transactions off the ledger completely, and is well suited for micropayments and privacy-preserving payment rails, but may not be suitable for more generalized scaling needs.
An ideal solution is one that allows multiple parallel blockchains to interoperate while retaining their security properties. This has proven difficult, if not impossible, with proof-of-work. Merged mining, for instance, allows the work done to secure a parent chain to be reused on a child chain, but transactions must still be validated, in order, by each node, and a merge-mined blockchain is vulnerable to attack if a majority of the hashing power on the parent is not actively merge-mining the child. An academic review of alternative blockchain network architectures is provided for additional context, and we provide summaries of other proposals and their drawbacks in Related Work.
Here we present Cosmos, a novel blockchain network architecture that addresses all of these problems. Cosmos is a network of many independent blockchains, called zones. The zones are powered by Tendermint BFT [8], which provides a high-performance, consistent, secure PBFT-like consensus engine, where strict fork-accountability guarantees hold over the behaviour of malicious actors. The Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm is well suited for scaling public proof-of-stake blockchains.
The first zone on Cosmos is called the Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a simple governance mechanism which enables the network to adapt and upgrade. In addition, the Cosmos Hub can be extended by connecting other zones.
The hub and zones of the Cosmos network communicate with each other via an inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, a kind of virtual UDP or TCP for blockchains. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another securely and quickly without the need for exchange liquidity between zones. Instead, all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each zone. The hub isolates each zone from the failure of other zones. Because anyone can connect a new zone to the Cosmos Hub, zones allow for future-compatibility with new blockchain innovations."
13,Stellar,XLM,2015,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/,https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf,The Stellar Consensus Protocol: A Federated Model for Internet-level Consensus,"This paper introduces a new model for consensus called federated Byzantine agreement (FBA). FBA achieves robustness through quorum slices—individual trust decisions made by each node that together determine system-level quorums. Slices bind the system together much the way individual networks’ peering and transit decisions now unify the Internet.
We also present the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a construction for FBA. Like all Byzantine agreement protocols, SCP makes no assumptions about the rational behavior of attackers. Unlike prior Byzantine agreement models, which presuppose a unanimously accepted membership list, SCP enjoys open membership that promotes organic network growth. Compared to decentralized proof of-work and proof-of-stake schemes, SCP has modest computing and financial requirements, lowering the barrier to entry and potentially opening up financial systems to new participants."
14,Cronos Chain,CRO,2018,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cronos/,https://whitepaper.cronos.org/,Cronos Whitepaper,"Cronos is a decentralised, open-source, energy-efficient public blockchain with high speed and low transaction fees. Cronos is designed to support the creator economy with Web3 applications such as DeFi and GameFi, ultimately serving as the foundational infrastructure for an open metaverse. Cronos is designed to serve the next billion Web3 users and to help them experience the full promise of self-custody of their digital assets.
Cronos is an Ethereum-Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain powered by Ethermint and built with the Cosmos SDK that supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Accordingly, end-users can import cryptocurrencies from the Ethereum, Cosmos and other chain families into Cronos, and subsequently use, trade or invest them in innovative smart contract-based protocols leveraging the rich application ecosystem of Ethereum / Solidity, and rapidly port apps & smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.
Cronos is fast, cost-effective, and frictionless. Cronos aims for high transaction throughput (from hundreds to thousands of transactions per second), fast transaction finality (5–6 seconds), and low transaction fees (from one cent to a few dimes). Its Proof of Authority (POA) consensus mechanism combines decentralisation with streamlined, scalable, and environment-friendly transaction processing. Cronos can deliver cheaper transactions than Ethereum mainnet, making decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts potentially more affordable, carbon-neutral, and more user-friendly.
Developers on Cronos can benefit from the support of Cronos Labs, a Web3 startup accelerator and ecosystem development fund. Builders and creators can tap into its $100m EVM fund."
15,Quant Overledger,QNT,2018,Cross-chain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quant/,https://whitepaper.io/coin/quant,Quant Overledger Whitepaper,"The traditional Internet architecture hasn’t yet achieved its vision of an open, trusted and secure network. The technology of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and their broad range of applications across finance, healthcare, supply-chain and many other sectors, is an opportunity for the Internet to adapt and honour what was originally envisaged, and reach its potential as a decentralised network of networks. While providing a broad range of benefits, the fast-paced environment of DLTs lack seamless inter-communicability, internally among ledgers, and externally with existing networks. This limitation forces distributed applications to be single-ledger-dependent, i.e. limited to be only executed on a single ledger. From a technology perspective, the fact that distributed or decentralised applications are single ledger-dependent, makes it difficult to choose the appropriate DLT fit for a purpose, meeting technical and business requirements when considering DLTs for decentralised applications. This technical dependency slows down mass-adoption, limits scope, impedes scalability of new features and reduces necessary controls required for data security and privacy. From a business perspective, a single-ledger DLT application increases the amount of risk, complexity and effort needed to adopt multiple DLT technologies, in many cases even duplicating resources and investments. Enterprises are forced to accept financial risk, due to a monopolistic approach to DLT fees, by limiting options to manage fees and transaction costs. All challenges listed limit widespread adoption and a critical mass of users. This paper proposes a solution to this problem of single-ledger dependency, by introducing a new technology for the design, deployment and execution of multi-ledger
decentralised applications. This technology’s called Overledger."
16,Agorand,ALGO,2019,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/,https://www.algorand.com/technology/white-papers,Algorand: Scaling Byzantine Agreements for Cryptocurrencies,"Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand’s BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed.
We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin’s throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users."
17,NEAR Protocol,NEAR,2021,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/,https://near.org/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/,The NEAR whitepaper,"NEAR is a decentralized application platform with the potential to change how systems are designed, how applications are built and how the web itself works. 
It is a complex technology with a simple goal — allow developers and entrepreneurs to easily and sustainably build applications which secure high value assets like money and identity while making them performant and usable enough for consumers to access.   
To do this, NEAR is built from the ground up to deliver intuitive experiences for end users, scale capacity across millions of devices and provide developers with new and sustainable business models for their applications. In doing so, NEAR is creating the only community-run cloud strong enough to extend the reach of Open Finance and power the future of the Open Web. "
18,Filecoin,FIL,2017,Cross-chain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/,https://whitepaper.io/coin/filecoin,Filecoin: A Decentralized Storage Network,"The internet is in the middle of a revolution: centralized proprietary services are being replaced with decentralized open ones; trusted parties replaced with verifiable computation; brittle location addresses replaced with resilient content addresses; inefficient monolithic services replaced with peer-to-peer algorithmic markets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks have proven the utility of decentralized transaction ledgers. These public ledgers process sophisticated smart contract applications and transact crypto-assets worth tens of billions of dollars. These systems are the first instances of internetwide Open Services, where participants form a decentralized network providing useful services for pay, with no central management or trusted parties. IPFS has proven the utility of content-addressing by decentralizing the web itself, serving billions of files used across a global peer-to-peer network. It liberates data from silos, survives network partitions, works offline, routes around censorship, and gives permanence to digital information. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that turns cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The market runs on a blockchain with a native protocol token (also called “Filecoin”), which miners earn
by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin
mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and repairing replica failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat models. The protocol’s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive layer on top of IPFS, which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts."
19,Hedera,HBAR,2019,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedera/,https://www.hedera.com/papers,Hedera: A Public Hashgraph Network & Governing Council,"The Hedera network will be governed by a council of leading global enterprises, across multiple industries and geographies. Its vision is a cyberspace that is trusted and secure, without the need for centralized parties with inordinate influence. Its licensing and governance model protects users by eliminating the risk of forking, protecting the integrity of the codebase, and providing open access to review the underlying software code. Platform governance will be decentralized through the  Hedera Governing Council, which will have a termlimited, rotating set of governing members that each have equal voting rights over key decisions relating to the platform.1 The Hedera network is a distributed ledger platform that resolves the factors that constrain adoption of public DLT by the mainstream."
20,Internet Computer,ICP,2021,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/,https://internetcomputer.org/whitepaper.pdf,The Internet Computer for Geeks,"Smart contracts are a new form of software that will revolutionize how software is written, IT systems are maintained, and applications and whole businesses are built. Smart contracts are composable and autonomous pieces of software that run on decentralized blockchains, which makes them tamperproof and unstoppable. In this paper, we describe the Internet Computer (IC), which is a radical new design of blockchain that unleashes the full potential of smart contracts, overcoming the limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains with respect to speed, storage costs, and computational capacity. This allows smart contracts for the first time to implement fully decentralized applications that are hosted end to end on blockchain. The IC consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that connects independently operated nodes into a collection of blockchains. These blockchains host and execute “canisters”, the IC’s form of smart contracts. Canisters can store data, perform very general computations on that data, and provide a complete technology stack, serving web pages directly to end users. Computational and storage costs are covered by a “reverse-gas model”, where canister developers pre-pay costs in cycles that are obtained from ICP, the native token of the IC. ICP tokens are also used for governance: the IC is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which, among other things, determines changes to the topology of the network and upgrades to the protocol."

22,MultiversX (Elrond) ,EGLD,2020,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/elrond-egld/,https://elrond.com/assets/files/elrond-whitepaper.pdf,Elrond: A Highly Scalable Public Blockchain via Adaptive State Sharding and Secure Proof of Stake,"The advent of secure public blockchains through Bitcoin and later Ethereum, has brought forth a notable degree of interest and capital influx, providing the premise for a global wave of permissionless innovation. Despite lofty promises, creating a decentralized, secure and scalable public blockchain has proved to be a strenuous task. This paper proposes Elrond, a novel architecture which goes beyond state of the art by introducing a genuine state sharding scheme for practical scalability, eliminating energy and computational waste while ensuring distributed fairness through a Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus. Having a strong focus on security, Elrond’s network is built to ensure resistance to known security problems like Sybil attack, Nothing at Stake attack and others. In an ecosystem that strives for interconnectivity, our solution for smart contracts offers an EVM compliant engine to ensure interoperability by design. Preliminary simulations and testnet results reflect that Elrond exceeds Visa’s average throughput and achieves an improvement beyond three orders of magnitude or 1000x compared to the existing viable approaches, while drastically reducing the costs of bootstrapping and storage to ensure long term sustainability."
23,Flow,FLOW,2018,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/,https://www.onflow.org/technical-paper/,Flow: Technique Papers,"The architecture of Flow is specified in a series of Technical Papers which explain the many nuances of the system. Technical Papers 1 & 3 have been released first because they are the most critical to understand and assess the soundness of the system while also including the results most applicable to other projects.
Technical Paper 1: Separating Consensus & Compute
The first paper describes the approach at the core of the Flow architecture: splitting consensus (selection and ordering of transactions) from compute (executing each transaction and recording its output) and proves this can dramatically increase throughput without compromising security. In this first paper we analyze how the Flow architecture increases performance, preserves ACID guarantees, and prove that it does not compromise security. The result is a throughput increase by a factor of 56 compared to conventional architectures without loss of safety or decentralization. The paper also notes that a working system based on these ideas must verify the computation (the subject of technical paper 3), but that its key result is applicable regardless of how that problem is addressed.
Technical Paper 2: Block Formation
The second in the series of technical papers formalizes the process of block formation and the Proof of Stake based consensus process in Flow. Flow adapts a variant of the HotStuff consensus algorithm for Consensus Nodes to come to consensus on the blocks they will honor at every block height. This paper also addresses the Consensus role’s responsibility in mitigating challenges submitted to the network.
Technical Paper 3: Execution Verification
The third technical paper answers questions posed by the first whitepaper around the verification of computation results. The paper provides a formalization of our verifiable computation scheme with proofs of safety and liveness under reasonable Byzantine assumptions. Although the paper does not explore the possibility, we believe this result could be adapted to other scenarios where Bulletproofs, TrueBit, TEEs, and other verifiable computation schemes are applicable."
24,Theta Network,THETA,2019,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theta-network/,https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets.thetatoken.org/Theta-white-paper-latest.pdf,Theta: Decentralized video streaming powered by users and an innovative new blockchain,"The Theta Network and protocol solves various challenges the video streaming industry faces today. First, tokens on the Theta blockchain are used as an incentive to encourage individual users to share their redundant computing and bandwidth resources as caching or relay nodes for video streams. This improves the quality of stream delivery and solves the “last-mile” delivery problem, the main bottleneck for traditional content delivery pipelines, especially for high resolution high bitrate 4k, 8k and next generation streams. Second, with sufficient network density the majority of viewers will pull streams from peering caching nodes, allowing video platforms to significantly reduce content delivery network (CDN) costs. More importantly, by introducing tokens as an end-user incentive mechanism the Theta Network allows video platforms to deepen viewer engagement, drive incremental revenues, and differentiate their content and viewing experience from their competitors."
25,Tezos,XTZ,2018,Blockchain,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/,https://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf,Tezos:a self-amending crypto-ledger White paper,"We present Tezos, a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. Tezos can instantiate any blockchain based ledger. The operations of a regular blockchain are implemented as a purely functional module abstracted into a shell responsible for network operations. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptonote, etc. can all be represented within Tezos by implementing the proper interface to the network layer. Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins with a seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting procedure itself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber’s Nomic, a game built around a fully introspective set of rules. In addition, Tezos’s seed protocol is based on a pure proof-of-stake system and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Tezos is implemented in OCaml, a powerful functional programming language offering speed, an unambiguous syntax and semantic, and an ecosystem making Tezos a good candidate for formal proofs of correctness. Familiarity with the Bitcoin protocol and basic cryptographic primitives are assumed in the rest of this paper."

Klaytn seeks to serve as a public blockchain platform providing an easy UX and development environment in order to convey the value of blockchain technology","From its onset in early 2018, Klaytn has identified blockchain mass adoption as its foremost goal. Ever since, the project has built a public blockchain network and a business-friendly development platform around it to help entrepreneurs and enterprises in various sectors build highly usable blockchain applications for a wide range of end-users regardless of their level of crypto-literacy. Klaytn believes that the full innovative potential of blockchain will be unlocked through the new breed of applications - services and products - that the technology unlocks, and that those new applications will deliver unprecedented utility and benefits to its users. In Klaytn’s view, this is how blockchain mass adoption will run its course - organic, user-centric, and natural as the next due step in the course of
evolution. To realize its vision, Klaytn will provide a comprehensive suite of blockchain application development environment, starting with a public blockchain network, development platform, and developer supporting tools. Klaytn development platform aims to imbue businesses with the capability to create
applications that integrate key qualities conferred by the underlying Klaytn public network, including transparency, security, and censorship-resistance. At the same time, the said platform supports enterprise-ready level scalability and performance in order to enable reliable business operations by massive international enterprises. To further strengthen its value proposition for businesses, Klaytn is built on carefully designed token economy, governance systems, and incentive programs to facilitate collaboration among diverse groups of contributors on its platform. Klaytn ecosystem participants include not only direct business partners, infrastructure co-operators, and governance participants, but also organic stakeholders such as developer communities, user circles, and other interest groups. Contributions from various groups are mediated and directed towards growing the ecosystem; Klaytn’s governance will support key growth activities such as maintaining its public network, advancing software development, growing a mesh of connected child networks, aligning interests among participants, and ensuring active participation in the governance decision making procedures. Paving the path towards a widespread adoption of blockchain technology by businesses and the wider body of end-users is an arduous task, riddled with challenges on many fronts. Nevertheless, Klaytn believes its vision of incubating the next breed of blockchain-powered services and products is the path to accelerate the arrival of the next phase of digital business evolution. To that end, Klaytn will continue to address numerous challenges that businesses face in their blockchain adoption"
